# Guessing Game

The classic beginner programming challenge.

## How it works

The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

## How to run

You need Rust and Cargo, click [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install them.

```bash
cargo build # compiles the project
cargo run # run the generated binaries
```
